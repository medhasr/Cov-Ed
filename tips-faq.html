      <button class="collapsible">Can mosquitos spread the virus that causes COVID-19?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.</p>
      </div>  
      <button class="collapsible">Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="collapsible">Is it advisable to wear a mask while exercising?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It is definitely NOT advisable to wear a mask while exercising, especially if you are doing yoga. Masks can reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Wearing it while exercising can make you more susceptible to the virus. Sweat can promote the growth of micro-organisms, which is not good if you are wearing a mask. Exercise at home. </p>
