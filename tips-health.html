      <p class="intro"> The ongoing COVID situation put a lot emotional, physical, and mental stress on everyone. But still, despite this impact, we must take the time to take care of our health. Here, in this section, we provided different ways to take care of ourselves. </p>

      <h3> Yoga and Meditation </h3> 
        <img src="https://www.naturehomeopathy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/surya-namaskar-step-by-step-procedure.jpg"alt="surya-namaskar" style= "width:50%" class="healthpics"> <br> 
      <p> Yoga is known for its benefits on both the physical and mental being. Yoga is also recommended to start off, or wind down the day. Spend this time for yourself at least 10-15 minutes in the beginning and/or end of the day. 
      Neuroscience related studies have shown that meditation and yoga have enlarged certain lobes in the brain, and produces more dopamine, thus giving a positive outlook on life. Therefore, it is a highly recommended activity.
      Surya Namaskar, as shown above is a good example of an exercise to start of the day. It strengthens your back, muscles, and lowers the blood sugar levels. It also helps with flexibility and mind relaxation. You can get started with your yoga journey by watching free youtube videos, such as the one <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithkassandra">here</a>.  <br>

    <p> Since we are at home all day, we are tempted to eat unhealthy snacks. This is also the best time to take care of yourselves, as you are home majority of the time. The key to a healthy diet is eating the right amount of calories each day, along with eating a wide range of fruits and vegetables. It is also important to have the right intake, that is not have an overintake or have a less intake. Overconsumption can lead to overweight bodies, while underconsumption can cause you to lose a lot more weight. It is also recommended that men have an average of 2500 calories a day, while women have 2000 calories day. Below is a list of some  ways to form a healthy diet.<br> </p>
    <ol>

      <p> It is recommended that you eat 5 types of fruits or veggies each day. Getting your "5 A Day Fruit or Veggie" is much easier than it sounds! A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g.Fruit juices, smoothies, and other soft drinks can count as a portion, but keep in mind a limit. Try not to drink more than a glass of juice, as it can have damage to your teeth. </p> 
      <li class= "listhealth"> Cut down on saturated fat intake </li>

      <p> Please pay attention to the type of fats your meals have. While saturated fats are needed to a certain level, too much of them can lead to high cholesteral in the blood, which increases your risk to heart diseases. Therefore, try to cut down on your fat intake, and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats, like vegetable oils, spread, and avocados. In general, fats are high in energy, so try to consume them in small amounts. </p> 
      <li class= "listhealth"> Eat foods with high levels of carbohydrates.</li> 
      <img src= "https://www.heart.org/-/media/images/healthy-living/healthy-eating/carbohydrates1.jpg" class= "fruitpics" style= "width: 40%">
      <p> Carbohydrates should compose 1/3 of your food. Some examples of carbohydrates are bread, pasta, and cereals. Try including at least when meal with starches in a day. People think that starches have lots of fats, but they in fact, have fewer than half a calories of fat. </p> 

      <li class="listhealth"> Stay hydrated</li>

      <p> Drink lots of fluids to prevent your body from getting dehydrated. It is also recommended that an average person drinks at least 8 cups of water daily. Remember to drink lots of water during the hot seasons and after exercise!</p>
