      <h2 class= "pagetitle"> Take Action And Help The Community </h2>
      <p class= "intro"> Due to the pandemic, many families and individuals faced tremendous losses. In this section, you can find ways to help your impacted community. </p>
      <ol>

      <li class= "takeactionlist"> Explore ways to volunteer virtually.</li>
      <p> The pandemic has opened a lot of virtual opportunities. Around the world, nonprofits are trying to come up with solutions and find ways to help. However, it all depends on the number of volunteers willing to help serve their communities. There are so many organization globally with different purposes, so you can help in a plethora of ways. Here are some examples of websites where you can find virtual opportunities: <br>   </p> 
        <ul>
          <li> <a href= "https://www.voly.org/"> voly.org </a> </li> 
          <li> <a href= "https://www.idealist.org/en/"> idealist.org </a> </li> 
          <li> <a href= "https://www.volnow.org/"> VolunteerNow</a> </li> <br>

        </ul> 

      <li class= "takeactionlist"> Give Blood </li>
      <p> According to the American Red Cross Foundation, there has been a decline in the number of blood donations after the COVID crisis has begun. This is what they had to say: <br> 
      <em> "Right now, the American Red Cross encourages healthy, eligible individuals to schedule a blood or platelet donation appointment at redcrossblood.org to help maintain a sufficient blood supply and avoid any potential shortages. Donating blood is a safe process and people should not hesitate to give or receive blood. The need for blood is constant, and volunteer donors are the only source of blood for those in need of transfusions.‚Äù </em>
      </p> 

      <li class= "takeactionlist"> Donate masks, sanitizers, and cleaning supplies.</li> 
      <p> Many hospitals and doctors around the world are having shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), which protects them from the sick. Therefore, they would deeply appreciate donations. It is suggested to call or look at local hospitals' and governments' websites for assistance, as donation methods do vary from city to city. It has been noted that the University of Chicago, for example, has been noted for it's high demand in sanitizers and masks. <a href= "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=c52e0493d0364479b56d709f0890f0ef"> Here is the the link to the center's donation. </a>  </p> 
      <li class= "takeactionlist"> Check on closeby neighbors! </li> 
      <p> Once in a while, it's okay to call or text your neighbors, especially if they are elderly. Ask if there is any way you can help them, or buy from them. Make sure not to come in close physical contact with them, as they are the most vulnerable!  </p>  
      <li class = "takeactionlist"> Appreciate workers </li> 
      <p> Take time to consider how you can give gratitude to all the clerks, shopkeepers, educators, doctors, firefighters, and all those other contributors who have been working extra hard to provide the community. It can be as simple as writing letters to healthcare workers or installing tip jars in stores to show appreciation to the clerksmen. Our choices are limited, but we can still express thanks to all the people working hard out there.  </p>
